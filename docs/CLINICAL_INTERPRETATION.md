# Clinical Interpretation Guide

## Pathergy Test Overview

The pathergy test is a diagnostic procedure used primarily in the evaluation of Behçet's disease. It tests for abnormal skin hyperreactivity to minor trauma.

### Test Protocol

1. **Sterile Puncture**: 2-3 intradermal punctures made with a sterile needle
2. **Location**: Volar forearm, arranged lengthwise (parallel to arm axis)
3. **Spacing**: 2-3 cm between puncture sites
4. **Depth**: 5mm intradermal
5. **Reading**: 24-48 hours post-puncture

### Positive Result Criteria

A positive pathergy test is defined as:
- Formation of a **papule** (raised bump) or **pustule** (pus-filled bump)
- Size: ≥2mm diameter
- Timing: 24-48 hours after puncture
- Appearance: Erythematous (red) papulopustular lesion

## Timeline Interpretation

### Day 0 (Baseline - 0 hours)
**Expected Appearance**:
- Small puncture marks only
- Minimal to no erythema
- Black "X" or "+" marker indicating test site
- Two small red dots from needle punctures

**Image Characteristics**:
- Clear marker visible
- Minimal inflammation
- Puncture sites may be barely visible

### Day 1 (Early - 24 hours)
**Positive Response**:
- Papular elevation developing
- Erythema (redness) around puncture sites
- Size typically 2-5mm
- May show early pustule formation

**Negative Response**:
- No significant change from baseline
- Puncture marks healing normally
- No papule formation

**Image Characteristics**:
- Marker may be fading
- Red/pink areas indicate inflammation
- Raised areas cast subtle shadows

### Day 2 (Late - 48 hours)
**Positive Response**:
- Well-formed papule or pustule
- Peak inflammation
- Size 2-10mm typical
- Central pustulation possible
- Surrounding erythema

**Negative Response**:
- Puncture sites healing/resolved
- No papule formation
- Minimal to no erythema

**Image Characteristics**:
- Marker very faded or absent
- Clear papulopustular lesions if positive
- Healing/fading if negative

## Morphological Features

### Papule Characteristics
- **Elevation**: Raised above skin surface
- **Consistency**: Firm to palpation
- **Color**: Pink to red
- **Border**: Well-demarcated
- **Surface**: Smooth or slightly rough

### Pustule Characteristics
- **Content**: Purulent (pus-filled) center
- **Color**: Yellow-white center with red periphery
- **Size**: Usually larger than papules
- **Border**: May have irregular edges
- **Evolution**: Develops from papule

## Differential Considerations

### False Positives
- **Infection**: Secondary bacterial infection (different from pathergy)
- **Trauma**: Excessive needle trauma
- **Allergic reaction**: To antiseptic or marker ink
- **Folliculitis**: If puncture hits hair follicle

### False Negatives
- **Immunosuppression**: Steroids or immunosuppressants may suppress response
- **Technique**: Too shallow puncture
- **Timing**: Reading too early (<24h) or too late (>72h)
- **Location**: Areas with thick skin less reactive

## Clinical Significance

### Diagnostic Value
- **High specificity** for Behçet's disease in endemic areas (Mediterranean, Middle East, Asia)
- **Lower sensitivity** in non-endemic areas (Northern Europe, Americas)
- **Part of ISG criteria** for Behçet's diagnosis

### Scoring Systems

#### International Study Group (ISG) Criteria
Pathergy positivity = 1 point (optional criterion)

Required for diagnosis:
- Oral ulceration (mandatory) PLUS 2 of:
  - Genital ulceration (2 points)
  - Eye lesions (2 points)
  - Skin lesions (2 points)
  - Positive pathergy test (1 point)

#### International Criteria for Behçet's Disease (ICBD)
Pathergy positivity = 1 point

Score ≥4 points indicates Behçet's disease:
- Oral aphthosis: 2 points
- Genital aphthosis: 2 points
- Ocular lesions: 2 points
- Skin lesions: 1 point
- Vascular manifestations: 1 point
- Pathergy test: 1 point

## Quality Assessment Checklist

### Image Quality
- [ ] All three timepoints captured
- [ ] Consistent lighting across images
- [ ] Test site clearly visible
- [ ] Proper focus/resolution
- [ ] Arm position allows site visualization

### Test Validity
- [ ] Proper spacing (2-3 cm) between sites
- [ ] Sites parallel to arm axis
- [ ] Marker indicates test location
- [ ] Timeline appropriate (0, 24, 48 hours)
- [ ] No signs of secondary trauma

### Response Assessment
- [ ] Baseline shows puncture only
- [ ] Evolution tracked at same sites
- [ ] Morphology documented (papule/pustule)
- [ ] Size can be estimated
- [ ] Surrounding skin reaction noted

## Important Disclaimers

1. **Not for Clinical Diagnosis**: This tool assists in documentation and visualization only
2. **Physician Interpretation Required**: Results must be interpreted by qualified medical professional
3. **Consider Clinical Context**: Pathergy test is one component of comprehensive evaluation
4. **Geographic Variation**: Test sensitivity varies by ethnicity and geography
5. **Quality Dependent**: Poor technique or image quality affects interpretation
